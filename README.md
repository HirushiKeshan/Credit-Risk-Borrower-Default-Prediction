# Credit-Risk-Borrower-Default-Prediction
In the contemporary banking sector, the efficient and accurate assessment of loan 
applications is paramount for ensuring financial stability and customer satisfaction and accurate 
prediction of borrower default can help mitigate these risks and enable lenders to make informed 
decisions regarding loan approvals and credit limits. Thus, accurately predicting borrower defaults is 
essential for lenders to make informed decisions, set appropriate interest rates, establish credit limits, 
and effectively manage their loan portfolios. 

Therefore, this project aims to develop a robust predictive model using machine learning 
classification algorithms to automate the loan approval process. This model is classification problem 
and it is used in predicting loan defaulters and Various techniques are employed in credit risk 
borrower default prediction, including traditional statistical models and discriminant analysis, To 
make the prediction model rules more understandable and thereby increase the userâ€™s faith in the 
model, an explanatory model must be used more advanced machine learning algorithms to leveraging 
the dataset comprising historical loan applications, demographic information, credit scores, and other 
relevant features, various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random 
forests, and support vector machines will be employed to train and evaluate the model's performance. 
Performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, are employed to 
measure the models' predictive power under different scenarios. These models are trained on 
historical data with known outcomes (default or non-default) to learn patterns and relationships that 
can be used to predict the likelihood of future defaults. The models achieve 99% accuracy. And XG 
Boost predict the model more efficiently its work with unseen data Through extensive 
experimentation and validation techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, the 
proposed model aims to achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall in predicting loan approval 
outcomes. The ultimate objective is to provide banks with a reliable tool to streamline their decision- 
making process, mitigate risks, and enhance overall operational efficiency in the lending domain.
